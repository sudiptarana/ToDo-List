## Features

- Native project ready to be built on to your device.
- Support for unimodules and auto-linking.
- OTA updates, and Gestures out of the box.
- Full support for React Native web.
- Plug-n-play custom templates.
- Works with the Expo Client app.

## Usage

- `npx create-react-native-app` Create a new native React app.
- `yarn ios` -- (`react-native run-ios`) Build the iOS App (requires a MacOS computer).
- `yarn android` -- (`react-native run-android`) Build the Android App.
- `yarn web` -- (`expo start:web`) Run the website in your browser.

### Templates

By default you create a [bare-workflow React](https://docs.expo.io/bare/exploring-bare-workflow/) project with support for iOS, Android, and web. You can opt to use an example project instead by selecting the "Templates from ..." option. Custom templates can be used with `--template <Example Name or GitHub URL>` option.

- Use an [example](https://github.com/expo/examples): `npx create-react-native-app -t with-typescript`
- Use a custom template: `npx create-react-native-app --template https://github.com/someone/my-react-starter` -- Only works with GitHub repos on the master branch.
- All examples can be modified in the [expo/examples](https://github.com/expo/examples) repo.

## Usage with Expo Client App

Expo Client enables you to work with all of the [Components and APIs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) in `react-native`, as well as the [JavaScript APIs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/index.html) that the are bundled with the Expo App.

Expo Client supports running any project that doesn't have custom native modules added.

- Download the "Expo Client" app from the Play Store or App Store.
- Start your project with Expo
  - Install the CLI `npm i -g expo-cli`
  - Start the project `expo start`
- Open the project:
  - Sign in to expo and the project will appear in the app.
  - Or point your phone's camera at the QR code in the terminal (press "c" to view it).

## Support and Contact

If you're having issues with Create React Native App, please make sure:

- The issue is not covered in the [Expo Docs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/)
- There is not already an [open issue](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/issues) for your particular problem

If you've checked the documentation and currently open issues, please either [open a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app/issues/new) or ask a question on [Expo forums](https://forums.expo.io/c/help).

## Contributing

<!-- Footer -->

There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should element DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
